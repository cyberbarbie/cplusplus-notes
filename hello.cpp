/*
A variable is simply a name that represents a 
particular piece of your computerâ€™s memory that has been 
set aside for you to store, retrieve, and use data.
int - whole numbers
double - floats (decimals)
char - individual characters
string- sequence of characters encapsulate by single- or double-quotes
bool - true and false 

Every variable has a type, 
which represents the kind of information you can store inside of it. 
It tells your compiler how much memory to set aside for the variable, a
nd it defines what you can do with the variable.

"Every variable in C++ must be declared before it can be used!"

Variable declaration:
Define the type and name

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  define type of data the tip variable will hold
  int tip = 0;
  
  ## output for user
  std::cout << "Enter tip amount: ";

  ## input to store as value in variable
  std::cin >> tip;
  
  std::cout << "You paid " << tip << " dollars.\n";
  
}
